"112690039014308295584","Ricard Lalander","5","So, if someone had said two years ago that I would sit and review a mass vaccination site in a trade fair during a global pandemic, then I would have asked the person concerned to drink something cold and lie down for a while. But now we are here!
Werlabs in Kistamässan was a well-oiled machine. No queue on arrival, quickly inside the exhibition hall. There was hand sanitizer and mouth protection for those who needed it. Markings on the floor so you could keep your distance. Quick and friendly staff showed me to the right place and after a short wait I sat in one of the many booths that stood in a long line. It was health fair meets vaccine bus meets airport. Quick check and quick poke and then out and wait in some kind of Kafka-esque giant hall where everyone sat spread out on small plastic chairs and stared at a small digital clock, as if it would make time go faster - the quarter of an hour you have to wait for possible side effects before you can go. There was about a 50 m queue when I went home, but the day before it must have been upwards of 300 m, but the queue moved quickly. Don't come too early, because that's when there will be a queue!
All in all, a well-functioning and efficient device. Easy to get to from most parts of Stockholm and easy to find. Recommended.","2 years ago","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNxLTlyeHR3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xee9fc9bd995f4c2b!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICq-9rxtwE%7CCgwI7dm8hgYQiIPs2gE%7C?hl=en","177","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112690039014308295584?hl=en","0.9","mass vaccination site, global pandemic, Werlabs, Kistamässan, exhibition hall, hand sanitizer, mouth protection, distance, quick and friendly staff, booths, health fair, vaccine bus, airport, Kafka-esque giant hall, side effects, queue, well-functioning and efficient device, Stockholm, recommended"

I got there about 30 minutes before my appointment because I wasn't sure how easy it would be to find from the shuttle etc. so I got there extra early just to be safe, I couldn't stress. I expected to wait outside or walk around waiting to get in line first when it was my turn, but there was no line at all and everyone who thought like me and waited spread out outside was waved in and allowed inside right away, so I clearly chose the right time. I was vaccinated and ready (including the 15 minute extra wait afterwards) before my appointment had even passed. I was pleasantly surprised.
The staff were knowledgeable and very nice, the roller coaster was like a well-oiled machine!
There is hand sanitizer, mouth protection and clear information everywhere, as well as clear staff everywhere, so everything was very easy.
Terribly organized and flexible when it comes to vaccination anyway, they know their stuff!!! 💜","2 years ago","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxMzluX2JREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xee9fc9bd995f4c2b!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDq39n_bQ%7CCgsI--nXhwYQgKiEFg%7C?hl=en","94","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100078186555539621104?hl=en","0.9","vaccination, appointment, waiting, line, staff, knowledgeable, hand sanitizer, mouth protection, information, organized, flexible"

However, the wardrobe was a sloth-like experience yesterday (28/9). However, better today (29/9) but still not effective enough for my taste.

One thing that was somewhat common was that a hook to hang your bag on was missing in many of the stalls in the ladies' toilet. I don't like being forced to put the bag on the floor. Kind of careless not to fix something so simple...

But, if it's a good fair activity, you still go there. It is, however, small things that drag down my experience of the premises somewhat.","a year ago","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURla1BUQ2pnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xee9fc9bd995f4c2b!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDekPTCjgE%7CCgwI0bHWmQYQwN2MtQM%7C?hl=en","202","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110308774242790952056?hl=en","0.1","fair, activity, Personnel, Manager, wardrobe, experience, effective, hook, bag, ladies' toilet, careless, premises, stalls, experience, taste"

In my queue (the one on the far left) it only went to one stall, each of the queues on the far right went to several stalls. Saw a guy who was 200m behind me in the queue into the building, who finished 30m before me precisely because he was in the queue on the far right while I was on the left. Sigh.

Otherwise, the staff were very helpful and nice... But the whole queuing system was messed up, which of course lowered the rating.

The exhibition hall itself is large and spacious. Plenty of toilets outside. Parking spaces are available at the rear of the building. You pay with the app Apcoa flow.

The Dinosauria exhibit going on right now, summer 2023, was interesting but not very big. You can easily complete it in 1-max 2 hours.

After Corona, everything is the same.
